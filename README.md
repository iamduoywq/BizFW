# BizFW

use delphi

Object Oriented Programming is not fun again for me.
I want to try Service Oriented Programming.
And I'm testing any idea by Delphi.
I named it "Biz Framework".
The first product is named "BizShell".

The BizFW base on "exe + dll". Each dll is called "Lib".
It can include DllObject, DllForm, DllFunc.

Anyone can use it for fun.
Also I add other "product" inside the FW.

If I have time, I will improve here.

Thanks
Duo
